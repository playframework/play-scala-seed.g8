# play-scala-seed.g8

Giter8 template for generating a Play project seed in Scala.  

This project is intended for people who know how to use Play and want to get started right away.

You should only need to clone this project if you are modifying the giter8 template.  For information on giter8 templates, please see http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/

## Running

If you want to create a project:

```
sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8
```

## Scaffolding 

Type `g8Scaffold form` from sbt to create the scaffold controller, template and tests needed to process a form.

You can also create your own giter8 seeds and scaffolds based off this one by forking from the https://github.com/playframework/play-java-seed.g8 or https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-seed.g8 github projects.

## Running locally

If you are testing this giter8 template locally, you should [install g8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/setup.html) and then run the [local test](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/testing.html) feature:

```
g8 file://play-scala-seed.g8/ --name=my-seed-test --force
```

Will create an example template called `my-seed-test`, for example.
