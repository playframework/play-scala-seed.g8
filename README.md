# play-scala-seed.g8

Giter8 template for generating a Play project seed in Scala.  

This project is intended for people who know how to use Play and want to get started right away.

You should only need to download this project if you are modifying the giter8 template.  For information on giter8 templates, please see http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/

## Running

If you want to create a project:

```
sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8
```

## Scaffolding

You can also create your own giter8 seeds and scaffolds based off this one by forking from the https://github.com/playframework/play-java-seed.g8 or https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-seed.g8 github projects.
